# Introduction

The film and entertainment industry has been growing and evolving vastly over the years, resulting in it being a multi-billion-dollar worth of an industry. From live theatre, to audioless black and white, to music and theatre, to television and big screens in cinema's, and now streaming. Film making and production has truly come a long way.

Streaming seems to be the big thing now, with organisations such as Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Disney, etc, taking advantage of the opportunities that have occured from this segment. These organisations have created apps where movies, series, documentaries, and other forms of entertainment in the film industry can be access anywhere, anytime, with only just a touch of a finger. These apps do not only give you access to the movies you want, but also learn more about which ones interests you best, and recommends them for you.

It is through algorithms that this is possible. Models are created and trained to learn what suits you through the use of algorithms. Therefore, the machine learning model learns your interests, such as the different genres you are into, the casts you watch the most, the years they were released, and more. Once it catches on all your interests, it recommends movies and series that meet your likeness. The purpose of this document serves to depict how models are created, trained, tested, and how they can recommend movies to your likeness so that binging is much easier.

# Project Description

As Phantom AI, we were approached by Tesla to work on a project that will assist them with one of their biggest innovations, and enabling to penetrate the film and entertainment industry. Tesla is one of the biggest companies in the world and was founded by the richest man alive. It's aim is to create highly innovative, sophisticated vehicles that are intelligent, safe, and have a less negative effect on the environment, as their vehicles release less carboon footprint compared to gasoline cars. However, their biggest innovation is the development of self driven cars. This innovation has given them the opportunity to penetrate certain market segments, allowing them to increase their reach and have a wider market. In a nutshell, they want to bring the cinema... to your vehicles.

They want to create a software that can be installed in their vehicles that will serve as a streaming platform for movies and series. This is convenient for the driver when he/she switches to auto-pilot so that the car drives itself, and the driver can relax and catch-up on his/her favourite shows. Therefore, Tesla has approached us to:

build, train, and test a machine learning model
build an app using streamlit services
deploy the model on the streamlit app to assess its effectiveness
